montiel Colombia an Audrey Lee from the

US of A who as well attends our meeting

here at home here in Riverside many

greetings

and blessings from our Elohim

yeah sure HaMashiach so then Audrey many

congratulations many blessings for your

birthday proverbs 25:2 it is the glory

of Elohim to conceal the word yet it is

the honor of the king to search out the

word all of the scriptures both false

and true contained in the Bible are

concealed that which is false is more

than obvious that it is concealed and at

the same time it's false so then it's

worthless and the true one is not clear

but how is it concealed and to be

concealed means that it is imperiled it

is concealed in parables even if it may

seem unbelievable our Elohim designed in

that way for his children to search to

study and to arrive at the truth by

searching out the word not because it is

clearly written but because it is

written in parables last week not this

week the 21st of June precisely three

days prior to Chivato there was a

Congress very special do you know what

Congress that was in that Congress

seventy years were fulfilled and the

Pope went and he gave a speech but

Congress took place in Switzerland and

it is called the worldwide Council of

Churches and the Pope was present and he

addressed the entire congregation which

represents all the Christian churches

asking for unity because this world is

broken because this world is in grave

problems

and that the only way to move forward is

through unity and it turns out the

worldwide Council of Churches is on at

70th birthday everybody in there brother

is on 70th birthday Israel the worldwide

Council of Churches and all that that

took place last week in Switzerland

football is still full-on gaining

followers and losing followers making

some sad making others rejoice and the

rhythm of by all the ball continues

which is all arranged and it's all

organized and since we know that Babylon

all they do is play with the feelings of

people and program them the people think

that it is all clean that it is all a

product of the ability and of the skill

of the teams and of the people but we

know that it is all arranged

once the deceivers and one thing we know

that did deceive us and everything

absolutely and everything that is why

Trump two weeks ago he organized two or

three weeks ago he organized a new army

a new line of the US Army you see how

you've got the Navy the army you've got

those divisions right well now he

launched the space force what is the

space force is it to fight against home

against oppose it extraterrestrial

attacks so then he organized a division

from the government in order to always

be at the ready in case of an

extraterrestrial attack that indicates

many things for example it indicates

that the government along with a zoo are

planning on a supposed alien invasion as

I've already told you in the great

blasian it turns out they get prepared

for something they are planning they've

already got the solution they first

generate a solution that no wooden was

about so as to later generate chaos and

then later present the solution they

have already have prepared always first

they prepare the antivirus then they

launch the virus and they sell you the

antivirus that is precisely the chaos

and solution strategy which is what

they've already got speaking about

current events in the world for example

Switzerland is the first country in

which almost entirely all of their

residents members of what are we call

them citizens they've almost all got the

chip in the hand on the right hand a

chip with that chip they pay for the

train tickets for the bus tickets as

well they pay for their transactions

they donate they go to the hospital

they've got all the convenient

information we'll call it convenient so

it's to not have to deal with wallets

with cash or information we'll still

well a garbage which you could lose I've

got it all in your hand if you become

unconscious they come and scan you know

who you are what blood group you're in

what type of medical problems you've got

what's your insurance how much money

you've got everything even even those

who are on the streets those who are

poor they've got a machine to be able to

get their donations with the chip or

with a credit card if somebody has not

gotten the chip yet he can donate with a

credit card to a homeless and the

homeless has a little machine that

receives money as the way it is cash is

disappearing but all this is actually a

system that is so sinister I mean just

stop to think

whether in your country wherever you may

be in the US as well as any of your

countries of a sudden the government

decides that there won't be any more

production nor will they accept bills

for money this dollar bill or something

anonymous if I find a bill on the floor

it's mine if I give you a dollar bill

it's as if you had earned it no one's

gonna ask you anything if you're gonna

buy something where you got it of where

you got it it is money that counts and

sounds and I'm having gone to the topic

I better have that piece papers and what

the thing but for now does for now does

with money you go and buy food with

money you go and buy gas with money you

pay debts now when that money

stop circulating just like it's

happening now you see news from

conspiracy theorists and all that about

the how that's gonna take place well

that's already taking place if as it

turns out as in countries like

Switzerland how this system is being

implemented it is because they want to

implement it everywhere so then just

stop to think that in your country where

you no longer have money real cash money

if I don't have a little card in the

best of the cases instead of a chip a

card with that card you go by receive

you do everything but what happens is

that every transaction you make and of

everybody else's in the world is left

registered there you cannot avoid taxes

everything you buy is left registered

forever inside a system because you pop

with your court it's your name there

won't be such a thing as those gift

cards which are anonymous no that would

be the same as cash I'll carve with what

you buy anywhere from a pencil to a

carrot it is left registered that what

day at this hour you bought with your

name and the account

you bought a certain article ain't

travel can't take any phone

transportation you cannot travel you

cannot

you cannot feed yourself without that

card now if that card it's transferred

to the hand what happens

mark control what happens is that you

have the control or who has the control

they've got all the control whenever

they feel like saying you know what you

are outside the law for whatever reason

I mean because you're against the

government or maybe you don't practice

the religion authorized by us for you to

practice get all the options there's

Catholic Adventist Mormon Baptist tank

speaking whatever you like no things I

don't want any of those oh you don't

want any of these you've also got the

Jewish one neither that one's those

blasphemous folk I don't want that

either

which one do you want then when I want

to practice then you cannot belong or be

a part of the system anymore they take

you out of the system they take out your

money you go and try to buy something

you can't buy anything because they

annulled it look at how this is starting

to get implemented implemented it is

rather impressive I mean the control the

people without thinking they render over

all of their control authority to

someone else

that someone else who is that the

government the government does with you

wherever they place they will control

even the last thing you buy from your

onions garlic the last thing you buy and

once they no longer like you for

whatever reason they'll remove your

privilege of buying even if you have

money you won't be able to use it they

will take it from you which is different

how can they take money if they uh know

your chip or card how could you get your

money up have you ever tried sometime

that you've lost your card your bank

card to take money out of the bank they

don't let you they don't let you no way

no how

right then I'll let you but what is the

money yours all of it yes but can you

use it now you can't use it look for

your card apply for your card so then

you apply for the car

you've gotta wait for a period of the

application and maybe you'll be able to

withdraw but maybe if they cancel

everything and don't let you apply what

happens there forget it it's over your

history is over you cannot feed yourself

you cannot buy anything all you have

left is to go out and steal that's all

you have left and from that you go

straight to jail and that's it

you no longer exist as a human being

well that is what's happening this is

reality not a lie the other problem that

the world is suffering the other little

problem is 5g technology if you don't

know what 5g technology is yet then

start to look it up online because

that's what's coming in the world

the 5g cellular technology uses a very

high frequency but as it turns out that

frequency the frequency they use because

all people care about our faster cell

phones they want faster surfing they

want to be able to get Wi-Fi from

everywhere they don't want they don't

want to ever have to run into a dead

spot where they can't connect they want

to be able to connect always and of the

best quality so to download their movies

or games or whatever or watch their

football or whatever exactly or to

continue to upload their selfies on a

permanent basis so then there's 5g

technology uses a frequency that alters

human beings that's the worst of all did

you know that the u.s. built some

weapons which are used to disperse

people which whenever there's a group of

people they focus some antennas they've

got and has anybody seen this in YouTube

I'm talking about yeah okay so what they

do is that they focus on microwave

antennas and what they do is they focus

them into a multitude or whatever and

they feel that they are burned alive

they feel a burning throughout all their

skin and they die because of the pain

all they have left is to escape from the

place because the sensation is to be

burned alive they are non-lethal weapons

what they call riot deterrent if you

haven't seen them look up in YouTube

non-lethal weapons

deterrent so yeah the US has them and

they use them whenever they would get

rid of a multitude they just focus their

antennas there and it would seem as

everybody were burning alive now had

their weapon in the past remember how

he'd confound enemies make vitamins and

seals not sure if it's the same

technology but a similar style gotta be

better all your shoes of course it's

gotta be better but this weapon this

weapon people feel like they're being

burned alive it's as if you were being

scorched because it excites your skin

pores skin pores have a very sensible

cell which receive the signal from these

microwaves and it starts to evaporate

the water that is on the skin and that

gives you the sensation that you've been

burned you're not actually being burnt

that's what they say you're not actually

burning but it says that you feel fire

but a type of fire that is torture and

all you have left to do is to flee from

the place as soon as you can okay that's

the same 5g technology see that's what

happens the very same wave only in a

lesser potency is the 5g which the whole

world already wants to have what does

that mean oh I can tell you what it all

means

it means that when 5g is implemented in

the world and all the antennas that you

see the cell phone towers become fight G

all of them all of them the trees those

fake ones that are antennas that you see

when you're driving there are all

antennas like that while all that will

become 5g what means is as follows that

when the government decides you will be

burned alive wherever you're where you

are that is turbo I don't know if you

are grasping what we're handing over as

little lamps to the government we want

that technology because they tell you

with this marvelous technology you will

build a download you'll be able to surf

online everywhere

there won't be is zones where you won't

have a connection you'll have a

superfast connection anywhere but what

they're not telling you

is that when they decide to fry you you

misbehave they fry you we're actually

living very dark days on this earth only

there will be a time that's if we're not

already in it there will be a time in

which only Yahweh will be able to

protect us there is no protection

against things which we don't see which

are those emissions there's no

protection whatsoever but our gonna put

on to protect yourselves nothing there's

absolutely no protection and that's

exactly what people desire to have that

they don't know that that is a weapon

actually a double-edged sword exactly

and actually their edge is pointing at

us Wow exactly whenever to decide they

frame but in that's it's over and you

get to a point of fright that it kills

you but the torture I mean are you seen

the type of world that we're living in

but people's turns out are lost in their

football uploading selfies in everything

which the world believes to be real

those are the things I don't want to

share with you because we not that we

are now in time of destruction were past

the seventy we're on the 71st and today

was and is the first Shabbat of the

seventy-first today is today is chef

ward 71

first Shabbat well we see things during

this 70 first Serb at that's if Yahweh

wants in the term that he wants because

we're writing the time which is time of

destruction party in it now it doesn't

depend on us it depends on your way of

when he will begin the gradual

destruction for this earth it does not

depend on us it depends on him but are

we already in the time of destruction

were well into the time of destruction

it could last one more day till

destruction starts it could last another

month

could last six months it could last

another year till destruction starts it

could even last more than a year till it

starts but that doesn't matter what

matters is that we're in time of

destruction prophetically because the

two texts of Jeremiah 25 and the other

one in Jeremiah say once are fulfilled

the 70 years I shall punish the king of

Babylon and all the nations all of them

well we're already in the time in which

the 70 are up what is the punishment

coming and possibly we have it noticed

that but we're probably already in the

punishment but we'll see that with time

but if we're not in punishment already

it's about to start

but it'll always begin during this space

of time and on its gradual right crius

its gradual exactly it'll no longer be

like it or no longer be like time of

Noah cuz back then because the point of

it was not as far as I understand the

point was not to make them suffer the

point was to kill all human beings as

quickly as possible that was the point

there was not seven trumpets there were

not seven plagues it was one alone the

water and they had to die as fast as

possible

it was not little by little it's not

gradual the water was not slowly going

up no no it says that seven torrents

from heaven opened up in the APUs of the

earth was opened this got flooded in a

tremendous way forty days of rain

everything was covered 150 days

everything was absolutely covered so

then that was fast

now what's coming up for us is not that

destruction but rather it's a

destruction with punishment that was

without punishment it was like a death

penalty but this destruction is with

punishment that's why there are seven

trumpets which are seven plagues and the

seven seals it is gradual right because

if it was fast how much would it cost

Diaw way to come

today and put everybody to sleep would

that cost him a lot nothing at all he

gathers 144,000 those were dead those

are alive he takes some and just like

you woke up today no one wakes up

tomorrow and how did they die in the

same way in which the firstborns in

Egypt died was that very costly it

didn't cost them anything so then for

what reason is time being lengthened so

much it is because well don't ask me

because I wouldn't understand I would

end it already but I'm not Yahweh I'm

not the Creator he always says I will

send punishment a time of punishment a

time which he called the Great

Tribulation as never before in our

virgon will be how much they're

accustomed to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah

tell me how long did the people suffer

seconds because when that rain of fire

and brimstone fell I don't think anyone

lasted not one hour alive there I don't

think so I didn't see it but I don't

think so

I believe it was minutes minutes dad to

run out of it running out of there

minutes

they have Chris without deviating too

much how would you feel a globe with

water for universal flood well the way

they explained it is due to the

attraction produced by gravity same

thing with oceans they explain

everything with gravity that's what they

fix everything that everything is

concentrated in the globe and nothing

falls off because it's all attracted in

every part of the globe it is exactly

attracted to the center that is how they

explain it it's a thousand miles and it

affects the coast on the other side the

thing is that gravity does not exist no

such thing as gravity exists but you see

I am answering the question the way they

explain it they fix everything with

gravity with gravity the Earth revolves

around the Sun and never what they

cannot explain nor ever demonstrate is

white doesn't leave the Sun there's

gravity functions the way they say but

it does not function eternally go around

in circle they cannot ever explain

that an attraction to another fire to

cause such a perfect attraction that

this one does not escape nor get too

close it is not a certain space and it's

elliptic in that elliptic space is

eternal to top it off they couldn't

explain that how is it that the earth

does not shoot off into space or the

rest of the planets or why they don't

get all swallowed up by the Sun for

example it's all nonsense that they do

not comprehend but we know that the

upcoming destruction will be gradual and

just like we understand that it'll be

gradual it'll start gradually just like

the flood started brutally like that of

Sodom and Gomorrah started and ended

brutally this one is prophesied all

backwards maybe some of you were

expecting a brutal destruction at the

beginning and then some rest

it couldn't be that way it'll all be

gradual just like in Killa where the

fire volcano started and now the

Galapagos volcano it's old set on fire

but if we are if we are now but are we

in the time yes we are in the time but

if it's already begun it's what I'm turn

say if the sequence has already begun

this will not stop but it'll increase

but it won't come suddenly just like in

birthdays

it'll be like birth pains it won't be

all the sudden as it is said as it was

in Noah's time and as it was in Sodom

and Gomorrah there are some conspiracy

theorists let's say that tomorrow the

1st of July

the government has planned something for

economy something brutal but it's

conspiracy theorists what could you

expect do you never get anything right

so do I believe it no I don't they never

get anything right how much could you

trust people that say I've got this

information that the government lake

nanana 0 0 0 trust but I'm telling you I

show you what's on line that for

tomorrow all of them have got or saying

that something will happen I don't

believe it I absolutely don't believe it

farewell then let us go into our subject

now we've already learned that true were

it's a sexual act that is what yahwah is

so jealous he compares worship towards

him with the sexual act if we worship

something that is not him he says you're

fornicating always throughout all the

prophets the same sorry he does not say

you are some adalat errs no no he says

you're idolaters and fornicators you

fornicate you fornicate you enjoy

yourselves you have sex with those with

with all types of Elohim

so then yah would not I because I

learned it from Yahweh Yahweh teacher

says that worship is intimately related

with with with sexuality is because if I

worship anything that is not him he

accuses me of sexuality of a sexual act

that takes me to fornication and

adultery he accuses me of that not I

I don't know kiss you he accuses you

we've already read all those texts and

that's what we've got the Shema what is

the Shema say Shema Israel Yahweh lo hey

new Yahweh a HUD here o Israel Yahweh

our Elohim Yahweh is one yahwah is one

once we've got that recorded in our mind

in our being in our entrails we start to

comprehend that when Yeshua came to

earth he never spoke about - even if it

seemed that way he never spoke about -

but actually it was a parable it was an

expression because Yahweh could never

ever have contract contradicted we could

never contradict but he himself said

that was something that every Israelite

should memorize because every Israelite

had to memorize it

put him in their doorposts tell it to

the children to repeat it well

you get up when you go to bed so then it

was something that was so for him so so

so so important that as it turns out he

was not gonna come and abolish that not

that when someone tells you to memorize

something for them later to destroy it

he could change other things but not

this exactly that has go ahead and read

some text some of which we've read in

some new ones as well as here 46 8

through 13 we've already read it but it

is necessary that we read it again I'll

read from the Spanish Martin yet though

remember this and understand it well

enter into reason you sinners remember

the former things of old that I am

Elohim and no other Elohim exist and

there is none like me this here is

something that's rather categorical

categorical he says remember this and

understand it well and turned to raisin

you sinners that I am Elohim yah was

speaking and now other Elohim exists and

no one like unto me from the beginning I

announced the end where is everything

announced in Bereshit and beforehand

what has yet to take place I say my

decision is carried on and anything I

please I do from the orient I called the

Eagle from a far country

the men have designated as I say it I do

it the way I've planned it I do it

hearken unto me ye stout-hearted neither

are far from righteousness I bring my

righteousness it shall not be far off in

my salvation

not Terry and I will play salvation in

Zion and my glory in Israel we've read

it many times already but following the

command of Yahweh that we've got to

record those in our heart because we

sometimes just read this text we read it

a couple times and then we forget but

we've got to have them clearly that's

why it says remember in order to

remember something you have to have read

it many times remember and understand it

in order to understand it you've got to

read it and read it and read it and

understand it well memorize it

exactly memorize it Joel 227 says and ye

shall know that in the midst of Israel

am i how many Arthur to say just didn't

say we are it kids say we are I don't

have any problem if there were 100 he

told him or a hundred on him are any

problems it I want to follow that which

is written in if it is written as a

command that there is only one there's

only one it's not that I only want one

it's not what I want to have it's not

what you want to have it is what it is

it is what it is if I want to have

something that is not what is indicated

then I am proud I am a person who does

not want Yahweh because he says I am

alone Yahweh there's nobody else with me

there is no one like me I am the only

Elohim that exists and here it says and

he shall know that in the midst of

Israel am I in that I am Yahweh your

Elohim it's not we are Yahweh it says I

am Yahweh and there is none else the

text is very clear and there's none else

I am Yahweh I am and there's no one else

and my people shall never again be

ashamed but his people shall not be

ashamed if they really believe that

Elohim is in Israel they believe that

Yahweh is Dylan

of Israel and believes that there's none

else that is where the people shall not

be ashamed now you shook him and said

and I shall send another the word

precisely that it says there is mother

the issue says I will send you another

and my father my father I in the other

so then one says either Yeshua's

completely alien to what's written

before or Yeshua is completely

disobedient and blasphemous against what

is written or the father he in the other

is one person alone there is the other

possible explanation which of the three

would you like because if we don't say

no no no than there are two there's the

father and the son there are two eloheem

as I used to say we don't have any other

option than to grab the talk and throw

it out and continue what we have

understood that the father and the son

are just them two

because the entire Tanakh is against the

father and the son the only father is

Yahweh and the only son is Israel I've

already explained that to you well touch

on that later we'll see those texts in

the Tanakh talk about father and son but

the son is Israel and the father is

Yahweh that's in the Tanakh southern the

only way of not being left confounded

and accept Yahweh and to accept Yeshua

is to understand that I assure when he

says my father it is he when he says the

Holy Spirit or the rock ha kodesh both

in Spanish as in Hebrew it is in the

feminine case it is also he and whoever

else comes is also he and wherever else

comes is also he otherwise it

contradicts all the text not just at the

Torah but of the entire tunic when I did

we talk about it or anymore

talk about the Tanakh which are the

Torah and all the prophets because it

wouldn't just make Moses false but all

the prophets false

Hosea 13 for Spanish DHH Yahweh says o

Yahweh

I'm your Elohim since you were in Egypt

do not recognize as Elohim anyone

outside of being how many other Elohim

can we recognize just your way no one he

says how many others can we recognize no

one except for Yahweh so when someone

comes along since I am the son of Yahweh

no no either you're Yahweh or you're no

one just like that either you're Yahweh

oh you're no one yes he says do not

recognize anyone else as eloheem so then

he says I am the son of Yahweh yeah well

I am the son of Gardo a French Argentine

songwriter and I'm the son of Pele he

they're polite comes to play who wants

play son sons in jail his name is Royals

will grow at the prophecy

Amina's Dame is not rare but Reb means

prisoner convict rail in Portuguese

means prisoner he is rel in prison

Sullivan here we've got to recognize one

alone and for some reason he forewarned

us and why would he do that because in

order to speak in parables and in order

to comprehend those parables we have to

understand the base clearly because if

we don't clearly understand the base

will never understand the parables the

parables will indicate something else

what's a parable it is a phrase and

expression a story which at first glance

says something else which is actually a

riddle which by knowing the base and by

knowing the symbols which are within

that riddle I can arrive at the solution

of the riddle so then the parable is

something which is extremely concealed

the truth is concealed in a group of

words which if I didn't have the base

the key and the actual meaning of the

symbols I will never get to the truth of

what the purple

never I'll take it like a mere parable

and nothing more than a parable southern

why would y'all we speak in parables so

that not everybody understands the true

meaning of what he's trying to say but

once we've got the base that says o

Yahweh your Elohim since you were in

Egypt do not recognize ever do not

recognize this an Elohim anybody outside

of me for only I am your Creator only I

am your Savior I'm your maker it says

elsewhere only I am your Savior how many

saviors can there be how many in a

soccer team that could be one or two in

a football team there could be I don't

know defense scores a goal and he became

the savior of the team but maybe they

need more goals and another one comes in

scores too and right there we've got two

saviors in one team but that only

happens in football here in scripture

for salvation yahwah tells us that how

many savers are there just the one okay

if Yeshua is the savior of the world

which all of Christendom accepts we've

got to define that you shows y'all it

directly because if yahwah says i am the

savior your only Savior and you will not

know another eloheem when someone comes

to save he must be Yahweh or he must be

false there's another option

he's either big charlatan just like that

either he's a charlatan or he's yahwah

in person

now if yahwah comes and makes a parable

for you that's when all the confusion

begins we have to clearly identify that

the one who gave to die the one who at

the sign the one that was doing all the

things was yahwah in person not the son

of Yahweh it was Yahweh and it was not

until little bro God that we started to

understand this before I

absolutely no matter how much I mean

I've told you I didn't find much sense

in for God so loved the world that He

sent His only begotten Son the loving

part didn't make all that much sense to

me but I did understand they were too

and I never doubted at them being - my

entire message was directed to two

people and the worshipping of two people

and in all of Revelation they would

worship elohim who was sit in the throne

and the lamb those points were the most

clear ones in the base topic of the

eternal truth the worship of - because

the parable indicates our worship of -

see this what happens that that parable

is not that we were false in

interpreting erroneously known the

parable without interpreting talks about

- the father and the son so then we

don't need to interpret much the parable

directly talks about - the father and

the son the father sent the son when we

go to heaven we're gonna see the throne

of Elohim and the lamb and when we read

revelation in the new land it says that

the heavenly Jerusalem will be

illuminated by Elohim and by the lamb

and he is in the throne of Elohim in the

lamb and the lamb says just as I sat in

the throne of my father you're gonna sit

in my throne and so once you read

without interpreting the purple and

there are two there are not three there

is always two now the Lord gave us the

key we've always had it there but we

just didn't understand it the Lord gave

us the key to interpret that parable but

in order to understand what we

understand now we've got to have really

understood that there were two beings

because that's what the parable says the

parable never talks about three beings

talks about two beans once we understand

the parable we now understand and we

decode because everything is in code we

decode the eternal truth and the eternal

truth is that there is one soul being

who is

our elohim and is the only one to whom

we must I don't want to use the word can

because we can worship whatever that we

must worship he is the only being that

really deserves worship because he's the

Creator very well then on top of that he

says I am your Saviour do not recognize

us an Elohim anyone outside of me not

outside of us but outside of me for only

I am your Saviour

if yahwah says that he is the savior

when the savior of the world came who

was he then yahweh absolutely yahweh

what the savior of the world sent his

son to save no absolutely not just like

that no because he says I am your Savior

is that clear do you have a couple

doubts about that Claire's water

okay here's in the text let us go to

well this one's not new we've already

read it but it's Dona read it because

this takes place in the new earth -

zechariah 14:9

zechariah 14:9 and Yahweh shall be king

over all the earth

on that day yahwah shall be one the word

a had one and one his name once all

being and only one his name which means

he's gonna no longer be called yahweh by

us and jehovah by the others has Shem by

the others other night by the others

Jesus by the others once all name he'll

no longer have different names one alone

for it is just one being this takes

place on the new earth so then if from

creation all the prophets and the new

earth speak about once all being who is

the elohim of israel and of us in

today's day and age how can this all of

a sudden change to own another - it's

the father and the son you see how

there's a mistake there there's an error

and the time has arrived to correct that

mistake which turns

this entire series yahwah Ahad is the

correction and the true understanding of

this parable now let us dig go to new

text 2nd Samuel 7 22 through 24 2nd

Samuel the second book of Samuel 2nd

Samuel 7 22 through 24 I shall read from

the Spanish store tourism ed it reads as

follows wherefore o Yahweh mine eloheem

thou hast exalted in the greatness for

there is none like unto thee neither is

there any eloheem beside thee it says

that yahwah eloheem of mine of ours of

israel's it says there's none like unto

thee nor is there any eloheem beside

thee this text is very clear our text

which I had not presented of be adding

text as I go according to all that we

have heard with our own ears and what

one nation in the earth is comparable to

thy people Israel whom thou has gone to

redeem to make of them a people unto

thyself in which thou hast made thy name

great with the wonders worked in their

favor and in whose presence thou hast

made so terrifying a work to redeem him

from the slavery from Egypt and punish

that land its people and their gods o

King for thou has chosen Israel that

they be thy people for ever and thou not

ye but thou o Yahweh Elohim art become

their Elohim an extremely clear text

there's one soul Elohim whose name is

Yahweh and that Elohim by the name of

Yahweh rescued Israel from the slavery

of Egypt and out of his well alone made

him his people and will be his people

forever that is the eternal truth found

in Scripture his people forever but for

one sole person so then if it's his

people forever when he came to that

people who came Yahweh or the son of

Yahweh Yahweh came it is absolutely

clear very well I'm gonna leave this I

was gonna read all these new texts but

I'll go ahead and leave it well I'll go

ahead and read this one I'm gonna read

this one because it's short it was

longer these are words of Solomon which

he said when he dedicated the temple the

first temple the Temple of Solomon this

what Solomon says at that moment in the

presence of Elohim and that presence of

Elohim was visible visible this is what

he said first Kings 8:56 through 61

first Kings 8:56 through 61 and I'll

read from the Spanish Jerusalem 2001

words of Solomon

blessed be Yahweh that had given rest

unto his people Israel according to all

his promises there hath not failed one

word of all his good promise which he

promised by the hand of Moses his

servant Yahweh our Elohim be with us as

he was with our fathers let him not

leave us nor forsake us that he may

incline our hearts unto Him to walk in

all his ways and to keep all his

commandments his statutes and

judgments which he commanded our fathers

and let these my words wherewith I have

made supplication before Yahweh be nigh

unto Yahweh Elohim

day and night that he maintained the

cause of a servant and the cause of his

people Israel at all times as the matter

shall require that all the people of the

earth may know that Yahweh is Elohim and

that there is none else how many others

are there there's none else

[Music]

let your heart therefore be wholly true

to Yahweh our Elohim walking according

to statutes and keeping his Commandments

as at this day marvelous words of

Solomon at the inauguration of the

temple before the very presence of

Yahweh well I will read this later

it is rather very very good text but

there long but we shall move on we can

read this later Matthew twenty to twenty

nine then answering you sure he said

unto them ye do er where do they and

it's not the people that herb mind ye

who Earth's the leaders the priests the

scribes it says 'i do err not knowing

the Scriptures nor the power of elohim

what is the problem with which we are

where are we some time to conclude

errors for what reason because we ignore

the scriptures and as well the power of

Elohim now to ignore this

Scriptures is not to understand the

parables or not even read them to allow

someone to feed you and that no thing

for you to be told that Sunday is the

day of the Lord from now on you accept

it and you keep Sunday that's a V ignore

scriptures but also to ignore the

scripture says to read the scriptures

and to ignore the true meaning of the

parables that is took erm yes or no and

I'll place myself in the first place by

saying that there are - that's what you

call ignoring because the entire tunak

talks about one so then if I do not

understand the parable I ignore the

meaning of the parable we agree with

that to ignore is not to know now

there's something else that puts us in

danger it is to ignore what the power of

Elohim of this I shall talk a little bit

about we already know that to ignore the

Scriptures is to ignore the content or

to ignore the parables any of the - it

is to read read and read and not to

comprehend that's to ignore even if I

know it by memory it is to ignore we do

agree with that right but there's

something else in which we also fail it

is when we do not comprehend the power

of Elohim and sometimes we enclose

eloheem in what we think that he should

be enclosed and we reduce his power

you see if we reduce the power of Elohim

so then what happens we ignore the power

of Elohim farewell then less Shabbat as

the foreground of Shabbat 71 which we

enjoyed on Sunday with some very

delicious loaves we made some

spectacular lehem some spectacular let

him wear those lehem delicious or not

they're very delicious very delicious

that's a bet

we had a study which was called a study

in Shabbat or the study of Shabbat which

bore the title of chevre 71 and in that

sermon or a study I wanted to make it I

mean still study but I wanted it in a

chat format without reading so many

texts only to express what I had already

taught and to leave clearly that what I

had taught was something that sometimes

there are certain people that don't

really understand what I've taught and

so then they misinterpret what I teach

it is important for you to watch because

tell the truth time really goes fast

there there's not much rating goes

really fast I mean it's just a chat and

it is very important because it is a

part of this topic so then those who are

watching this series

maybe not live watching this series

being us we're now in the bride of

Yeshua twenty-four might be a good idea

that before continuing with this topic

you go and look for the video called the

study of Shabbat of what 71 this series

Studies on Shabbat Chev or 71 just look

up chef what 71 and the link will pop up

so you can watch that video because

there I explained what I've been

explaining but in a definite way about

the essential key point that for me I

clearly said it that Yahweh for Israel

and for us and for the world is one

alone but that does not mean that he is

the only Elohim that exists and I'm

gonna again talk about that because it

is necessary and I also want for a

little bit to be left in this series

where do we see that Yahweh has a father

and very likely as I believe a mother

where do we see this where do we see

this embedded sheet let's get a bit of

sheep better sheet 126 we've got to go

back there because as it turns out

I want to go back to read this text and

as well I brought something from a book

in Hebrew from a Hebrew book it's in

Spanish it's a Hebrew book made by them

it's not Christian mind you it's a book

of the Jews which has commentaries from

the Talmud and the Sartre other things

and it isn't necessary for me to give

you the title of the book because you're

gonna desperately want to go out and buy

the book as if there were great light in

it it is complete garbage that's why it

isn't necessary for me to even give you

the title of it because there are some

of you that love that garbage and you

want to go and buy it I bring it to you

so that you only hear how they think

today's judaism not just of today but in

the time of years showing on what they

think about what i'm about to read but a

sheet 126 says and elohim said let us

make man in our image after our likeness

and let them have dominion over the fish

of the sea and over the fowl of the air

and over the cattle and over all the

earth and over every creeping thing that

creepeth upon the earth farewell then

then said elohim let us make there's one

time i believe it was drink to our i in

one of my interpretations i said that

that let us make sometimes it's an

expression

it is sometimes an expression that we

all use when you're gonna make something

alone you say let's do this it could be

said by a president to the people who's

not gonna do it things like we're gonna

do this but he says it so as to be

accompanied by the people in sentiment

sometimes just do not say look the only

one's gonna do anything here's i

sometimes a boxer who's gonna box by

himself says we're gonna try to win

they say for example you say you have an

idea one will fight but it says we're

gonna try to win what do you saying

you're all gonna beat on him no no just

one but we have that expression i'm

saying we're gonna do this we're gonna

do

that point of view is feasible and I

interent believer in one subject there I

told you it could be that it is Yahweh

speaking with his angels and he tells

his angels let us make men but there

won't get him participate because

clearly in the next exorcism yahwah made

it is say Yahweh Elohim along with the

angels made there is only one creator

but that expression of let us make I

told you that it could be ours speaking

with angels okay now I've got to say

what days today June 30th 2018 that that

is completely absurd not just absurd but

it is almost blasphemous for what reason

I'm about to explain for what reason if

it said let us make man in mine image it

would be all right because we note that

the angels - don't have Elohim Zimmy j--

they don't they have another image the

only one that has elohim's image is who

man

so then Elohim cannot say or tell

another being let us make man in our

image that our destroys that yah was

speaking with an angel and if you think

that yah was speaking with a group of

angels he had to have said let us make

men in mine image like that like that it

is acceptable even if it was only yah

with the one creating he can say let us

make man in mine image not your image

he's got a serpent next to him something

extremely weird and those are the angels

it can't be our image do you follow but

I want this point to be clear those are

some of you are still insisting no no no

that Yahweh and they're right to me no Y

always speaking to the Angels here no no

no yeah I was not speaking to the Angels

y'all was speaking to another being

who's equal to him once you're

understand this this is an absolute so I

want this to be left engraved in your

minds that we have one soul Elohim the

Bible here defines that there are many

elohim's at least - and I believe there

are more but that doesn't matter

ricourt this because if you believe that

yah was one alone and that there isn't

another yahwah

grab better sheet and toss it into the

garbage can once and for all because in

the text that says let us make man in

our image let us make our let us make

our is our one alone I mean a team has

to be very crazy to say I mean if he's

alone to say let us make well he's gonna

make it

and then his as an hour when there's

once all image if there's one so being

with the image that we have he could

never have set our are you understanding

this is that clearer is it not clear

logical it is lurk here so then there

are more than 100 Haim now that those

Elohim have nothing to do with us

that is very clear as I've given you the

example my dad who was it might put a

view the best Adventist pastor I saw cuz

some may criticize me that I've badmouth

had my dad I never spoke ill of my dad I

wouldn't be sitting here in front of you

if it wasn't for my dad if I had that

received the excellent education that

gave me in all aspects of life excellent

to be the best person possible that

everything that I did to do it well

oh not do it at all that was all

teaching on my dad to me this is very

low he would not let me do one thing if

I was gonna do it imperfectly he would

tell me don't do it unless you're gonna

do it perfect if you're gonna do it you

do it in the best way possible

you could not be sitting here and joined

this message if it wasn't because of my

father and how my parents brought me up

both my dad and my mom my dad and my mom

they are exceptional people with the

values they gave me net that they

religiously believed my dad already died

in my mom in three that is their problem

but as human beings they are excellent I

never saw another pastor like my dad

ever given to his work honest that what

he believed that's what he would do that

he would never give you a word in the

name of love God I'm gonna use that

because they used those words if he

didn't believe it completely absolutely

I used to feel what my dad would do I

felt it I lived it I was a cradle

Adventist ever since I was born I know

how

in my home how crystal clear it was

there was no falsehood no hypocrisy nor

anything what was said upfront that's

what we lived at home always so then my

dad I always saw him as a person who I

mean I would look at other pastors and

they were worthless in my sight as soon

as my dad would preach I was in the

front row and if he started to preach

about prophecy I've already told you

many times Daniel and revelation which

he would present once a year but I

couldn't wait for him to present it I

will sit even if I knew the mode by

memory I will sit in the front row and I

was attentive to what my dad would say

at all ages because as it turns out I

met as you may imagine a whole lot of

pastors but none like my dad my dad was

the best the way he would speak when my

dad would pray I would feel his prayer

when other pastors would pray I thought

it was a soap opera but they didn't even

believed themselves seriously it was

insufferable but if my dad would kneel

down and pray it would seem as if he had

a direct communication with him directly

with God I remember that he presented

Brian Fermi in the seventh-day Adventist

Church of Loma Linda because I didn't

want for him to even be touched by

another pastor whomever I never believed

in other pastors I was almost pigs I saw

him like that why me both of men g2o he

presented angie actually oh he presented

both of them okay he presented both of

them I would never allow another pastor

my dad also baptized me just so you see

because my cousin jumped I don't know

what my cousin was listening to but see

if you're listening today let's see if

you're listening clearly today my dad

baptized me my dad married me and my dad

presented my children any other pastor

was worthless to me because I know them

I lived from the bosom of my home and I

know the honesty that was lived at my

house how my dad would get up at 4:00

5:00 a.m. to pray he'd get up and pray

and he would live he lived

what he believed in I never saw the

hypocrisy

see I mean a joke about scripture never

every time we talked about scripture as

deep as possible

I was against all I was against many

things that were asked him about and he

would defend him as well as he knew how

about wine and other things he would

defend but I always saw honesty in him

and even when my dad came and presented

my children at the church

my dad presented both my children's same

time after my dad and it is prayer in

Loma Linda some of the Brethren came to

me and said hey do you think your dad

might like to come and preach unto us I

mean they all wanted to shake his hand

they even told me I've never heard a

prayer like your dad's they're like wow

because here I don't know why everybody

prays here with such a notion I don't

know I just cannot transmit it to you

you feel the prayer it is felt whether

there's really a communication or you

feel whether the person is really

pouring is giving a conversation without

hypocrisy unto Yahweh but of one thing

you can be sure of to make it clear my

dad was the most phenomenal pastor I've

ever seen in my life and as a person

completely phenomenal and that's why

yahwah called them to rest before he

gave me the message to me because we

were gonna have war I was not gonna

leave my dad alone I leave my mom alone

but not my dad I wasn't gonna leave him

alone I wasn't gonna leave him alone and

stop bothering him because he's my dad

and because I need the honesty he had

before his death

my sister confessed to me before he died

he says he called her and told her

Viviane he says I never understood who

Jesus was but now I understand it and I

cannot tell you that was the last thing

he said and Vivian told me just like I

don't know he just wouldn't tell me

because I was giving the message to my

sister she's like he didn't want to tell

me but he told me now I understand it he

was like I understand that it's all

Jesus is like now I understand it he was

understanding this alone in his deathbed

right before he died then he died you

see what people understand

mind that really is so personal so

personal but I can assure you if someone

understood that Oh spirits of them and

dad know now you've already understood

what I spoke about my dad if my dad were

to show up here today what does he have

to do with the eternal truth nothing

hasn't anything to do with it except for

the fact that he brought me up as a

person but when side by side with

eternal truth and the message he's

completely foreign do you follow

foreign is no authority to speak here

he has no message to give us here

he has know that well I don't want to

use certain words but it is perfectly

understood right he has no authority and

no message he can't be a leader here a

kid received respect from all of you I

mean obviously that is obvious that is

the relation that Yahweh has with his

father his father who must be the most

phenomenal father there is obviously he

must be the most phenomenal father and

he must have the most phenomenal mother

as well and I don't know if he's even

got aunts and uncles I don't care about

that

I could care less it doesn't interest me

because it's not revealed so don't get

me wrong if there were a thousand dollar

Hema I'd like to meet him all I'd like

to meet every last one but when I say

that I could care less about something

is that it doesn't interest me because

I'd be making something up so then I am

reduced to that which is written what is

written says let us make man in our

image there are at least two yes or no

let us make man in our image according

to our own likeness

for the third time it says ours let us

make one our another plural our likeness

so the never I want to remove that never

is Elohim speaking with the Angels is

that clear he's speaking with a beam

that is his equal

who's the same image and he says let us

make man in our image and let them have

dominion over the fish of the sea

because as it turns out Elohim is a

dominating race it is a race that has 30

over the fowl of the air over the cattle

and over all the earth

and over every creeping thing that

creepeth upon the earth here eloheem is

not in any way if possible speak with

angels

none whatsoever I want to leave that

absolutely clear let's go to the

following text better sheet to 21

through 25 but it is also clear that in

the following text which is didn't write

here that in the following text it says

and created hey them it doesn't say they

create it did you see that

so then how many creators are there one

now the fact that he says as in the tone

of advice because if he's got a father

can the father advise him of course

obviously he can obviously he can advise

him he can speak with him he could be

present all he wants tell Jacob now I'm

telling everybody I'm telling you to and

Jacob are me because we were arguing

about that this morning the cordon ami

if Elohim okay so Elohim clearly told us

that there's only one in him for Israel

that does not take away that he's got a

perfect relation with his father yeah

but not his father with us because that

was their design that was the design so

then in creation can he ask an advice

from the father

sure thing of course logically of course

he can because if we believe that Yahweh

was born of a father don't you believe

that he is very proud for his father

taught him everything oh it's so mature

it's fallen off the tree it is only

logical as Armando would say that there

is a relation between the actual father

and the son I'm not talking about the

father and the son in the parable I'm

talking about

his actual father so then of course he

could have consulted his father many

things of course absolutely of course I

never said that he and the father are

not on speaking terms all that he died

nor that he died as it is in my case nor

that he left his house

Yahweh's case when his house and makes

his own world and no longer speak to my

father

we don't speak anymore no I have not

taught that so then there's clearly a

relation now he also clearly said that

for us his creation he is absolutely the

only Elohim there is for us as worship

but it is clear there is more than one

aleem more than one so then he says let

us make man in our image and in the next

text that says and Elohim created it

doesn't say they create it but he

created Ferelden now let us do garage

Betty she too 21 through 25 which says

then yahwah eloheem caused a deep sleep

to fall upon Adam and as he slept and he

took one of his ribs and closed up the

flesh instead thereof and the rib which

yo Elohim had taken from man made he a

woman and brought her unto the men Adam

then said this is now bone of my bones

and flesh of my flesh she shall be

called woman because she was taken out

of men therefore okay before that

therefore this is our real story that

took place but it's also a parable in

six days he created the world

yeah we'll owe him did is that real or

is that just the story it is real but by

making that real he's also making

parable do you follow

because in six days he really created

the world but also in the things that he

really was creating every day that was a

prophetic parable of a thousand years

every day do you follow so then within I

mean are you following cuz you're kind

of quiet you see out of something real

that he creates it is also a parable

once we apply it at a prophetic level do

you follow

okay so then he created the world in six

days he created on the Shabbat and

created the week but during that week he

was creating something else he was

creating a prophecy of what he was gonna

do in 7,000 years so then he really

created and by him actually creating he

is also prophesy on what he was gonna do

so then it is a parable out of something

farewell Dhin if you understand that

then we also understand that man man

represents Yahweh and the woman

represents us his bride and everything

which is written here which we've

already studied represents something in

order for us to comprehend the truth 24

says therefore shall a man leave his

father and his mother this Adam could

not have said because he does not

comprehend the concept of father and

mother

he's a being that was never a child he

was born as an adult he does not

comprehend the concept of being a father

nor of having a father and a mother he

was never a baby Adam was created as an

adult he's the only human ever created

as an adult

Adam had no childhood people even joke

about that and if he had no childhood as

children we used to say what's something

that Adam didn't have he didn't have a

bellybutton because they didn't have an

umbilical cord he is created directly I

mean that's a joke it's a joke also that

about Adam being a motherless but what

are you laughing about about expression

Adam was motherless as well as

fatherless no father to beget him he was

created as an adult he had no memories

of ever being a baby he had no memory of

ever growing up he didn't have the

memory of what the love of a father and

a mother is how is Adam going to say

that therefore shall a man leave his

father and his mother and shall cleave

unto his wife how's that I'm never gonna

say that he can't he cannot but he can

say it if it is written by Yahweh so

that is left for us that were inside a

parable that Yahweh is the son that left

his father and mother that is the only

sense it can make because again

comprehend at this point time Adam knows

not but he can even have

let's start there he's a being that it

was just created on that day he's not

telling us a hundred years later okay

once he knew his wife he had not even

known his wife at this time Eve had just

been presented to him he looks at her

and says this is one of my bones and

flesh of my flesh you shall be called a

shock because if I am ish then your eyes

sha male female but then now he goes

into a speech about what a father and a

mother is but doesn't know about that do

you think that I'll aim just placed that

in him as added wisdom I don't think so

that's experience that's experience

southern why is this written here

therefore says Adam who hasn't any

experience at all first day of creation

therefore he says shall a man leave his

father and his mother Adam never had a

father and mother didn't even know what

the concept of father and mother was are

you understanding or you think that I'm

here making up stuff Adam has not even

the concept of a father and mother is

and shall cleave unto his wife he didn't

even know that he had to get married and

he shall cleave unto his wife and there

shall be one flesh so then what does

this mean

clearly there's no other explanation

that the one is speaking is Yahweh and

Yahweh is saying that when he gets

married a only father and mother and

shall cleave unto his woman who is his

wife that's why it's called the pride of

Yeshua the bride of Yeshua then Yeshua's

away when yahwah gets married he was

gonna leave beings equal to him or his

parents actually last text I will give

you just in case you have not understood

that there's more than one Elohim let us

go to better sheet 322 and this is

something that's rather fabulous as

everything else we've seen up until now

more than fabulous it is determining as

everything we've seen up until now

determining there can't be any doubt and

I actually as I've told you I don't care

whether you think there's only one if

you think there are two or three or five

I could care less what I care about is

by what I teach what I

is that there's more than one team who

have nothing to do with us but there's

more than one Elaine Betty she 322 says

and said yahwah eloheem who's speaking

there Yahweh Elohim Behold the man is

become as one of us all done it's docked

to the angels again no he was never

talking to the Angels start there I've

already demonstrated to see that he was

not talking to the Angels I'll repeat

again behold man what man the sinful man

that knew good and evil

behold man is become as one of us of us

is more than one do we agree or not are

we all in agreement

Armando yep we agree okay one of us

knowing good and evil

oh one of us knowing good and evil so

then that means that that race of Elaine

which is more than one was there could

be many mind you I don't want to risk it

at all they could be many but the one

who's ours his name is yahwah eloheem

that's how he made himself be known to

us the rest I don't know when I say I

don't care does because I don't want to

elaborate but I do not know now it's I

believe in what is written it is more

than one and now with this that it says

that they know good and evil

yahwah knows good and evil these are not

the Angels these are they they know good

and evil then Yahweh Elohim said Behold

the man is become as one of us to know

good and evil and now lest he put forth

his hand and take also of the tree of

life and eat and live forever

and you'll be like one of us no no that

can't be what y'all were Hindu took him

out kicked him out and put in charge a

certain special weapon that could be

handled by an angel for them to not

enter into the Tree of Life it is very

clear

yahwah says let us make man in our image

according to our own like this and then

says careful Koosman has become as one

of us as one of us knowing good and evil

what I want to teach today clearly if

you don't understand it just in case

Yahweh had I'm gonna place here father

I'm gonna write mother and out of these

two came out a beam whose name is called

Yahweh I'm gonna write let's use okay

blues find Yahweh Elohim so that no one

gets confused I don't want anyone to be

confused about what I teach of course I

say that there is one for Israel for the

world for us one that one is Yahweh

Elohim now that he has a father

absolutely that he has a mother I

believe so

that there could be more there could be

more and this Yahweh Elohim became at

some point in time during a time Yeshua

HaMashiach but that there are at least

two three or more at least there are two

now three I believe so more than that

possibly but Yahweh Elohim is the son of

the father that father has nothing to do

with us or with the world this is

completely apart from worship the only

worship of the created world that we

call earth there might be other worlds

there might entirely be other different

worlds I do not know it but I know that

when the scripture talks about creation

it talks about the creation

corresponding to me that Yahweh Elohim

is our only Elohim there is

if above him he has other types of of

not other types but fathers mothers and

all that beings of his home family

that's perfectly well with me but he

said I am the only Elohim for us it's as

if so that you understand when you get

married at home who's the only man of

the house the husband is the only man of

the house there can't be another one

that comes hey can I get in on this over

the wife says hey how about how about

another men in the house could could the

wife do that yes you could but who is

the only that and how would you call

that adultery adultery so then in one

house

how many men masters of the house are

there how many one one is there more men

in the world of course are more men in

the world but for the wife and his

children let's say a complete family for

the wife and his children

how many men with authority Arthur one

in his house period period if they want

to bring another that's adultery

comprehend it that way this house is the

house of Yahweh Elohim who has a wife in

he has his children his father his

mother are Lehane absolutely do they

deserve honor from us the day I meet him

yes but for now he said I'm the only one

like when a man marries a woman he says

I'm the only men you will have the only

one that's it it's over you already know

what happens in those marriages that the

wife has the son of another you know

what happens well in this perfection it

is that way I mean is this easy to

comprehend or not I wrote it here

because if I were to tell you there's

only one your mind flies until there's

only one there doesn't exist anymore no

no of course not I mean the Torah

specific what it says let us make man in

our own image after our own likeness

that is clear and then he says careful

because man has become as one of us as

one of us did you want to know

before wreath book I want to read

another text for you which here it's not

told him speaking better sheet 11 6

through 11 here there are not two Elohim

speaking but it is Yahweh speaking with

his angels I will give an example here

of Yahweh speaking with his angels

because I've not already know you're

gonna write to me

hey we found this here and we found this

other one no no don't believe that

you've also found that I'm gonna read it

just in case

better sheep 11 6 through 7 and yahwah

said Behold the people is one and they

have all one language and this they

begin to do and now nothing will be

restrained from them which they have

imagined to do go to let us go down

what's it say

more than one will descend yah was

speaking but now he is speaking to the

angels let us go down do you see the

great difference there he tells his

angels that it could be the first

principal angels or many mothers what's

ours say let us go down let us go down

and there confound their language that

they may not understand one another

speech there it is clear that yo is

speaking with his angels do you follow

Ferelden why is it that in the other

text it is absolutely clear that he's

speaking with another eloheem in that

angels because it's in our image in our

not image of the angels but here it says

let us go down and there confound

Yahoo speaking with his angels this is

not the father telling the Sun hey son

let's go down because there's a whole

mess ton dirt no no no no no do you

comprehend yes or no ok let us go down

to parish seed 18 Bereshit 18 1 through

2 and it reads as follows later appeared

Yahweh he appeared unto Yahweh who

appeared into him yah we did is it

difficult for you ever to appear in form

of him being no absolutely not then

Yahweh appeared unto him in the plains

of Mamre and he sat in the tent door in

the heat of the day and he lifted up his

eyes and load three men so then the

entire journey came down no I mean I

asked you because they turned Harry and

seal eternity here if you haven't heard

of eternity and sermon how many men did

he see three they say it was a father of

the son Holy Spirit 3:3 here are the

three and lifted up his eyes and looked

and lo three men who stood by him and

when he saw them he ran to meet them

from the tent door and bowed himself

toward the ground here again there is

not three lehem here it's not the father

sudden mother but rather Yahweh and two

of his angels those who came and now

will do we clearly see that what I'm

saying

in the text of 1833 I will read eighteen

which were reading I will read text 33

until nineteen one it reads as follows

and Yahweh went his way one of those

three men was Yahweh and Yahweh went his

way after speaking and arguing with

Abraham y'all left after he was done

speaking with Abraham so then Yahweh

left as soon as he stopped seeing if

they were him and Abraham returned unto

his place nineteen one and there came

two angels to Sodom so then you had

yahwah and who else

what do you mean the Trinity I mean the

scripture is clear it says that yahwah

came with two angels those two angels

are the ones that went to sodom there's

no eternity those three men one was

Yahweh the other two were angels in

human form obviously I mean obviously

and there came two angels to Sodom at

even in lot sat in the gate of Sodom

alot seen them rose up to meet them and

he bowed himself with his face toward

the ground where well continuing with

the story because in this story I

believe that in got the Sun I don't

believe it's online yet which is good I

think I took it out because it has Paul

and white a whole lot of things and got

the Sun and maybe in another sermon as I

had learned it from adventism not that I

made it up that comes straight from

Adventism we saw to yahwah eloheem here

let me to yaw him yet to yahwah eloheem

people are come bare to love to say this

text they love it but did you know

something it's complete garbage

because it's mistranslated let's go to

bed of sheep 1924 same story better

sheep 1924 are there total heme here if

someone was a fan of gum bet that

they'll remember what I'm saying

Bereshit 1924 Boer also says it and I

know that also from Adventism better

sheep 1924 says then Yahweh here's the

first one they say then Yahweh rained

upon Sodom in upon Gomorrah brimstone

and fire from Yahweh the second one out

of heaven so then we've got one Yahweh

on earth with Abraham or maybe he was

already done talking to him but he's

still there and we've got one Yahweh in

heaven you see that is what the text is

supposedly saying here we see both

Yahweh's gum betta would say to yahwah's

yahoo on earth and yahweh in heaven but

this is nothing but a bad translation

it's nothing but garbage that's what it

is it is absolute garbage look let us

read in the new the New Living

Translation did you know did you know

what the problem here is the problem

here is that it doesn't say Yahweh from

heaven this should clearly say the way

it is written in the New Living

Translation as well as in other versions

this should read as follows then Yahweh

among go ahead and read this version the

way I would correct this version then

Yahweh caused to rain upon Sodom and

Gomorrah from heaven fire and brimstone

which is of Yahweh he says not that yah

was in heaven but rather that the fire

brimstone came from heaven

that's very clear absolutely clear it is

a stupidity

a stupidity to say that there are two

hours there's only one Yahweh not two

yahwah's Yahweh is the name given to us

for now that we have he has not given me

any other name but there's only one

Yahweh not to Yahweh's are there many

other ahim yeah from here or not there

are many eloheem well not sure if many

but there's at least one and maybe two

and I don't know how many more but here

there's only one Yahweh and yeah was the

name not Elohim the New Living

Translation says better sheet 19:24 then

Yahweh rained down from the sky fire and

burning sulfur on Sodom that's the way

the text should say the Bible of the

people of God versions reads as follows

the book of the people of God then

Yahweh caused to rain upon Sodom and

Gomorrah sulfur and burning fire that

descended from heaven what descended

from heaven the fire and brimstone

descended from heaven it's not that

yahoo was in heaven but i perfectly

remember all the service of Gambetta to

yahwah's here

yahwah on earth and yo in heaven that's

what you call a lie that straight out

lie a very very bad interpretation okay

now I will read from the book I will

give you the title because you

desperately desperately when I've gotten

by it I have so many bugs I don't say

hundreds of Judaica books because I need

to know certain historical things and

certain things to see how they see it

to understand whether it could be that

way or if they are as it's mostly the

case entirely mistaken I will now read

the explanation to you because there are

some that say no no the Torah does not

originally say let us make man in our

image that it says I will make man in

our image might this be true because

there are some that say the trust says I

will make man in my image and after my

own likeness when alone they say who is

Yahweh well that is a lot

the original Torah and unfortunately for

them the Jews it's and plural but

they've got an explanation but I've

never heard a stupider explanation than

this but I'll go ahead and read it

because it is a part of your teaching

it's Shabbat and you have to know what

these blasphemous men say this is an

analysis or a steady if you will about

the Torah apparently they're analyzing

the draw here that's why any and all

that any and all things come out of them

so then I'll read 26 directly with their

version this is their direct version

this has nothing to do with Christianity

this is printed in Israel it says and

God said they say God and God said let

us make a man in our image according to

our likeness that he have dominion over

the fishes of the sea and over the birds

of the sky and over the beasts and over

the earth and over every reptile that

creepeth upon the earth and here begins

the explanation this entire explanation

that I'm gonna show you in tiny letters

which I will read to you this was the

text that it was here which is in Hebrew

it's in Hebrew you can barely see it

there it's in Hebrew it's in Spanish and

then you've got the entire explanation

ooh the entire explanation it reads as

follows God said let us make a man in

our image Rashi one of the greatest

Jewish wise men Rashi explains although

no one has helped God in his work of

creation and even though the heretics

what do they call as all of us that

believe in more than one of the name the

colors that were white for addicts

because we believe that other Elohim

exist but for us is one alone they

cannot comprehend that concept it says

and even that the heretics may use this

expression in the heretics or the

Christians mind you they call the

Christians heretics may use this

expression of blue

ality against monotheism

arete against lee understand and even to

the heretics may use this expression of

plurality against monotheism the Torah

has not wanted to pass up the

opportunity of giving us here a lesson

of modesty with the plural let us make

it teaches us that in certain occasions

the superior one or Almighty must

consult with his inferior and solicit

his consent I'm reading the way it is

written in mcurtin anything they done

screwed if the Torah had written I shall

make man we would not have known that

God consulted his counsel and we would

have thought that he formed his project

alone on the other hand the verse I'm

reading us is the verse that follows is

enough to refute the argument of the

heretics which says in God created man

and not they created I've already

explained that to you one alone is the

creator the problem is what is prior let

us make not exactly in the original text

of the Midrash rava from where raschi

inspired in Suffern this commentary it

is said in a way that's even more

explicit that when mo che knows Moses

Moshe wrote the text but God was

dictating to him when he got to this

passage he asked look at what they came

up with

I mean pay attention get this is fun

this is more fun than to watch football

because this is a so proper that you

never heard of they explain to you this

taken out from the Talmud they explain

to you what happened at the moment in

which Moshe was writing down what elohim

was dictating to him so what happened it

says when he got to this passage he

asked why do you provide the her

they're saying that Moshe asks Elohim or

God why do you provide the heretics but

the words let us make men a pretext to

confirm their polytheistic theory it is

very clear because the Bible talks about

polytheism for us it's monotheism but

it's saying that there's more than one

little hanging but they themselves are

telling you that it is written not that

they don't believe it that's something

else but they're telling you why did I

bring that to you so that you don't

think for a second that the Christians

added that don't even think about that

it is directly written like that in the

truck do you understand why I'm reading

this to you ok and I'm reading this to

you to see how the heck they explained

this and here's the explanation

Moses is complaining to Yahweh why are

you dictating it like that God replied

right exactly shut your mouth and write

just write and listen to what supposedly

God said I mean these guys make God say

whatever in all things but look and see

whether this religion is not false God

replied and said right and he who will

let him earn being his men shall be the

master of the creation it is convenient

that he consults with the superior

spheres as well as the inferior ones to

ask of them their consent an opinion

thus man will learn from me that the

greater must solicit the approval of the

smaller before imposing a chief on him

that raava's prefers to imply a formula

that possibly could allow for

misunderstanding and even favor the

polytheistic air before renouncing to

proclaim a fundamental moral norm the

lesson given us here by the Torah from

the very first page is of the utmost

importance in fact they are many the

passages of the Torah the turn out to be

ambiguous are there are many um

for their beliefs dark and even

contradictory the very same people that

don't understand the thing are telling

you this mind you that there are

passages in the Torah that are what

ambiguous dark and contradictory what

happens is that in these cases the tena

hide critics should not hesitate to

doubt the authenticity of the sacred

texts by formulating arbitrary judgments

upon their supposed authors or also in

resolving the difficulties in a way

that's expediting by crossing out

certain passages altering them or

disfiguring them it's saying that we

should not even think about how someone

may have stuck their hand in the trough

that's the way they are we must accept

them that way the texts that they said

that our biggest dark and wet

contradictory these are the aberrations

of human minds that the divine voice

apostrophe s by saying that he that will

let him

again they quote what supposedly God

said I just don't get these blokes these

deeds directly say God said now of

course they quote him that God said that

if they will earth let him earn the

teachings which are moral philosophical

historical and else that the

incriminating texts contain and that the

Talmudic exegesis usually places in

evidence are of infinitely more

importance than the deceiving

conclusions of the heretics deceiving

conclusions of the heretics

I've a this is rather interesting defend

it interesting okay that's Judaism for

you for the divine legislature the moral

and doctrinal worries prevail over the

full logical considerations fellow

logical mind you and even historical

this concept of the universality of the

Torah

which initiates here the text in Genesis

is like a general advert given to us by

the same as in respect to the

difficulties of the text that it

contains now that's what he explained

about let us make man in our image now

you're gonna explain in our image and

after our likeness now it gets a bit

more serious let's see what they

explained so then that little part of

the text is gonna explain in our image

and after our likeness the best of all

the explanations that have ever been

given about this text writes naagmani

this is the one that relates the word

Selim it is written with the team the

beginning solemn with the appearance and

face gesture with the term DeMuth with

man's body language which is similar to

the rest of the earthly beings or

anthropomorphise did you know as I've

already told once Judaism does not

believe that Yahweh has our form they

see our way that he cannot be seen nor

will we ever see him because he has not

our form I want you understand that

they're about to explain that here being

as men is similar in body to other

creatures and in soul to the superior

beings in fact what better reflects the

image of God is the face of the holy and

righteous men filled with wisdom

kindness and love his greatness and

spirit built with grace his features his

intelligence illuminates his gaze and

the flame that burns within him confers

to his entire being the radiant splendor

that inspired the psalmist with the

following words man is almost equal to

the divine beings that's well translated

the divine being but not the angels you

have crowned him with glory and

magnificence we have read that in Psalms

and it is absolutely clear

man has been created in God's image in

the measure here they explain here comes

the live in the measure that he bears

within himself a spark of the divine

spirit it is thanks to this spark that

man is unique below in the same way that

God is unique above he is the only beam

from below that knows good and evil for

among all the creatures only he

possesses free will look who's talking

about free will and that's fine that's

fine

consequently he has the capacity of

dominating matter with his spirit

thanks to that divine spark his soul is

immortal and I agree the word immortal

means mortal inside that does matter

eternal

I agree mind you but I'll explain that

later I'll explain that later yes well I

just wanna say about the word philology

it is the science that studies the

written texts and end in the structure

and evolution of a language and its

historical and literal devout man well

that's what we do philology the language

that studies history languages its

development in languages that's

interesting very interesting very

interesting indeed thank you Danilo

because that word is rather interesting

fellow gee no his souls are mortal I

agree I won't explain it today immortal

in the good sense of the word not in

what the word actually means his soul is

not mortal I agree I agree but I won't

explain it today because it's not today

subject man has I know I'm gonna sound

like the Catholic Church you see how in

the church you see how I was born in an

Adventist home and I was perfectly

taught the first thing I was taught

after the table the Shabbat was that the

soul the soul is not immortal the soul

is completely mortal as I was taught

exactly that the soul dies and the

Catholic Church talks about the

immortality of the soul now

I believe in the complete immortality of

the soul but I won't explain that today

I'll do that later or else this gets too

long I'll explain that today later

remind me and I'll explain it I see your

faces right there that are completely

perturbed do not be troubled let not

your heart be troubled or Monda or

anybody but I do believe in the

immortality of the soul but that's not

today subject ok so then he says thanks

to the divine spark his soul is immortal

I agree which ignites in him the light

of intelligence which allows them to

know God love him and be one with him do

you see how long he beat around the bush

to tell us that we don't even look like

Elohim we're similar only because of a

spark just a tiny spark it was by

insufflating in his nostrils the breath

of life that the Creator introduced that

spark in every human being but also the

corporal form of men even though he only

is Maher dust from the ground designed

in the likeness of God I don't know how

they added this here in his worry for

discarding the very least suspicion of

anthropomorphism what he just said as

difficult as that word is to pronounce

is that as it turns out we must discard

the most faint idea that Elohim looks

like us or that we look like eloheem

anthropomorphism we must discard the

faintest of suspicions maimoni this

another great Jewish Wiseman considers

that the words image and likeness the

way it is image and like this must be

interpreted in a figurative sense when

it says that man was made in the image

and likeness of Elohim it is only

figurative not literal but figurative

well yeah figuratively we could make her

say whatever

but actually I wanted to read this to

you that you know what Judaism is that's

why you and when I say you I know it's

not all of you but there's always those

who I say something and they go and get

hosts from juice sites as if it were a

great light they're nothing but garbage

all of Judaism along with its religious

practices this is what the practice

religiously this if you want to go and

live in Jerusalem then go ahead and give

to Jerusalem and practice Judaism go

ahead and practice Judaism back to the

Talmud exactly so then it says that they

must be interpreted in a figurative way

rabbi yehuda how Levi adopts on his

behalf the conception known under the

name of conception of the microcosmos

another one that made up another theory

all that just to say that we don't look

like Elohim that's all that it is

according to which men miniature world

exactly reflects in both his physical

and psychic Constitution the structure

of the macrocosmos or universe

this theory dates back to the extremely

ancient Safed it sida attributed to

Abraham the patriarch or according to

other historians to the Tanabe Akiba

affirms that there is a parallelism

between the physical Constitution of men

and the functional nature of the

universal soul the head corresponds to

the sphere purely spiritual of the

metaphysical world so then the head is

the sphere of the globe the chest

responds to the elements of well an

action of the intermediate emanations

fierce between the spirit and matter

lastly the members and the inferior

parts of the body are the incarnation of

the physical functions

the material world it says for more

details consult the Cassidy I mean if

you'd like a little more details you

could go and consult the Cassidy and

whatever else thusly men represents in a

certain way the shadow projected upon

the earth by the divine majesty celeb to

write some tell which is shadow

according to the interpretation of the

rabbi moshe cordoba oh why am i reading

all this to you I'll repeat it again for

two reasons the first of which to leave

confirm that the Torah says let us make

man in our image the Christians didn't

make that up and secondly to see the

insanity presented by the Jews how do

you think that a Jew could now accept

Yeshua as Yahweh if they say in their

toxins very low that Yahweh does not

even have an image like unto us that he

is an inaccessible being and that when

we go to heaven all we're gonna do there

all day is study Torah and all of their

highest wise men all they do is study

Torah

if you heard about two years ago about a

Jewish boy he went to a synagogue and he

said that he had a vision do you

remember I told you he had a vision when

he was taking to heaven he was declared

medically dead for a few minutes and he

was taken to heaven and he says that in

heaven he saw all the saints we dropped

some names they were all studying Torah

I'm like what the hell are we gonna go

to heaven to study Torah for I mean it's

difficult enough to study Torah now

because of certain boring parts that it

has we're gonna go to him such wrong I

mean in that case he'll must be more fun

thousand times over I mean who wants to

go to heaven to study Torah you've got

to really be someone that has a lot of

think Oh matter here to study Torah in

heaven they don't even understand the

trial here what are they gonna stand in

heaven we're gonna go study Torah in

heaven that's the most you know why they

say that because since Elohim will never

have any type of relation with the beans

at all then all they have left is to

continue reading the book that they have

the tall farewell then I'll read the

other one the other commentary it says

and God created 27 and God created men

in His image in the image of God created

he them male and female created he them

now they explained the insistence now

they got nervous the insistence were by

the Torah highlights the fact that man

was formed the image of God allows us to

extract certain conclusions at least

they say that there's insistence right

it's obvious it's obvious it says it

allows us to extract certain conclusions

about the motives of the creator in fact

man

in fact man is presented to us as the

beam that takes the highest place in the

hierarchy of creatures

if the eternal one wilt for this

perfected being to have the same

features as his it was undoubtedly

because he desired to share his eternal

goodness with those of his creatures

that were likened to him so then this

comment says that yeah we could look a

little like him it was in fact by love

as the surah proclaims whereby God

created heaven and earth the almighty

King who is enough to himself

voluntarily renounced to a part of his

being so as to propagate his love to

those like unto him he fell back on

himself

making a gift of his being unto men and

this act of abnegation originated the

creation of space thusly love was what

inaugurated the relations between God

and universal life and in the same

way love is what precedes the birth of

human life very well then and I'm not

going to read anything else because I

believe that the point is already clear

the point has been made clear what is

the point that there is more than one

eloheem at least two I believe there are

more father and mother at least in

yahwah eloheem who is our eloheem only

eloheem for the world and for Israel the

only creator that exists John 1:29 this

is all clear right John 1:29 Owen how

has time advanced 142 or 140 140 so then

Wow

I mean I don't want to make them too

long what I want is for the topics to

really be understandable because I see

that if I give you away too much

information you just take one part of

the other and you forget about

everything else okay John 1:29 says the

next day John see if Yeshua coming unto

Him John the Baptist so that you sure

was coming toward him and said behold

the lamb of elohim which taketh away the

sin of the world very often the phrase

the lamb of elohim is the same as to say

the lamb of yahweh we agree with that

right i want us to stop and think about

this a little bit because the entire

scriptures have been opened to see how

much people understood how much they

understood how much we understood John

the Baptist sees show coming toward him

and says here comes yahwah's animal

don't laugh

is a lamb an animal or not absolutely

but he didn't say here comes our way but

what comes if you were to read a phrase

that says here comes the dog of

Christian what would you understand one

understood that Christian is a dog and

the others understood that it's one of

my five dogs

which of the five dogs of Kristen is it

then it's not a dual meaning cream here

comes the LEM of Chris no one would

misinterpret that how about the Dove of

Christian no right there you would

interpret it that is the wife of

Christian because y'all you guys do to

sexualize everything okay so then but

let's go back to the phrase John the

Baptist says here comes the Lamb of

Yahweh did anyone understand that it was

Yahweh that was coming no just y'all's

animal do you notice that when we say

the lamb of elohim actually we always

understood that it was yes sure yes or

no clearly so we never saw him as the

Lamb of Yahweh but we saw him as Yahweh

in the form of the lamp okay okay I want

you to get this because this will start

to click in your mind if someone says

here comes the lamb of elohim the lamb

of Yahweh or mind always accept that the

lamb of Yahweh is Yahweh in the form of

lamb when someone says here comes the

son of Yahweh what should our mind say

as say that yah who's coming okay no

repeat or say what I said I'll start

over

if someone says here comes the lamb of

elohim our mind says the one that's

coming is eloheem in the form of lamb do

we agree or not okay then

so then if someone says here comes the

son of Elohim in the form of a son okay

you didn't repeat my word because in

your mind you're not getting it I'm

gonna repeat it once again the lamb of

elohim our lamb immediately says that is

eloheem in the form of lamb we agree so

then the son of Elohim or the son of

Yahweh is Elohim in the form of son are

you comprehending how it's the same

thing when I say whatever phrase that I

say the lamb of Yahweh is Yahweh himself

the son of Yahweh is Yahweh himself the

Messiah or Messiah or The Anointed One

is yahwah himself it's all

Yahoo himself this is the anointed of

Yahweh is it Yahweh or not it is yahwah

in the form of an anointed one it is

Yahweh in the form of mashiac it is

Yahweh in the form of a limb it is

Yahweh but you know that we're okay

right - one yeah one form of a man it is

Yahweh in the form of a son when we talk

about the father

it is the father in the form of the son

ah the right there already is the only

concept that we held onto is true when

we say the lamp immediately we say no

it's not the lamb of elohim it is Elohim

the Messiah no it's not the Messiah it

is Elohim whatever name we would just

transfer it but if we say the father I

know that's the actual father and this

is the Sun when we should have

immediately translated it as the son of

Elohim yes or the father is the father

in the form of the son last way it had

to be exactly exactly

so then I wanted to actually leave you

with that text now so as to wrap this up

to wrap this up because I was gonna give

you John 16 but we're gonna leave that

for next week just to wrap this up I

want to tell you something which one of

you from the eternal truth wrote to me

and told me some time ago and at first I

found it odd I found it weird then I

stopped to think about it and now I find

it pretty not weird

very good if we believe that Yahweh who

is completely Abney present we agree

with that right what was a problem again

that we ignore and we know not the

Scriptures and what else and we ignore

the power of Yahweh when we say that

yahwah came in a human form and

concentrated all his power in that human

body right there were ignoring the power

of Yahweh do we agree with that okay

right there to say no yahwah

concentrated himself in a human body and

he is no longer omnipresent but he is

you know present like we right there

we've got a brutal error the air of

ignoring what the power of yahwah

because yahwah is uncontainable yes or

no okay then

if he told us that Yahweh was

uncontainable how can a human body

contain him

okay then how what I'm about to tell you

what I'm about to tell you may sound

weird to you I wasn't gonna explain it

to you after John 16 bell dude now to

wrap this up

when yahwah came to earth and we know

there's only one elohim one alone no

more the rest of them exist but do not

belong to our creation when he came to

earth we would ignore or not know the

power of Yahweh if we were to say let us

completely limit Yahweh to a body I

believe that in some way that we cannot

fathom let me see if I can explain this

well in some way which we can't quite

grasp or understand Yahweh made an

extension of himself in Yeshua but at

the same time was Yahweh himself but

it's as if in his power which is huge he

extended himself in Yeshua he had not a

spirit or soul like we it was he himself

in that human body but he never stopped

being Yahweh all-powerful at the same

time

so then Yahweh was in heaven and Yahoo

and Earth at the same time once all

being but divided like an extension do

you understand

okay so when he would speak in praying

to himself was like a communication

between himself not between himself in

himself from here but between himself

from here and between himself there are

you following I know it's a difficult

concept that text that says which I

won't read today which I always saw as

had been added some sites at it maybe

it's not added that you should said I am

Darla hem that descended from heaven and

which is in the son of man I am the son

of men who

ascended from heaven who is in heaven I

don't exactly remember how it says who

is from heaven who is in heaven the son

of man who descended from heaven who is

in heaven he made us understand that he

was still in heaven at the same tent

that he was on earth if we did not

understand that then we do not

understand the concept of the

omnipresence of of Yahweh we ignore what

the power of Elohim southern I want to

make you think a little bit he did

before you misquote me he did not turn

into two beings he didn't become two

beings what you could get to thinking

that Yahweh went into another being

another being was born it was the same

one but at the same time there were two

no no no it's the same one in his

omnipresence he was the same one

question can yah would be here today and

may himself be visible and also make

himself be visible in Russia watching a

game of football could he or not could

he speak with us and be over there so

then how difficult was it for him to

initiate a human life as he had never

done before

not sure himself as human but to

initiate an actual human life not to

make an apparition and to disappears he

did with Abraham but to take human life

as a child but at the same time can any

be a way could he do that or not I mean

what could he not do exactly there's

nothing impossible for him exactly

exactly so then I haven't understood

that concept the way you're

understanding it now no question comes

up what did yahwah do would you sure his

body that he took on himself

because that body of you is sure that he

took is a body that he never had we

agree with that right something new but

that new thing he was not going to take

for the rest of his life

for all eternity you mean for all

eternity

he wasn't once he took it here did you

know that there are certain very strong

Adventist theories which for me was a

difficult battle I've already told you

I'll tell it to you again cos our new

people that was in fifth grade fifth

grade the last year of highs

cause you call it over here which is

that over here the 12th 12th grade from

high school what's the last year wait

both well I was in 12th grade which in

Argentina is the 5th grade of junior

high I was in the Adventist Academy of

del Plata and as it turns out my Bible

professor was the director of theology

he was the principal over there and as

it turns out he was precisely my

professor he was Chilean the guy was

good with people and all that since I

drove him crazy with my questions

one day he even invited me to his house

to eat on a Friday he had me over for

dinner a delicious dinner he said

Christian why don't you keep your mouth

shut in class we would get along so

great so great if only you shut up

because I drove him crazy the guy

invited me to his house he is like

Christian I know that your questions are

valid but I have a job to do with just a

teach they ended up kicking me out from

the Adventist Academy of del Plata they

kicked me out halfway through the year

they called my dad they called him

please take your son from here we can't

take him here anymore not a day longer

what's the problem he said well he keeps

arguing with the director of theology

said either mr. Silva leaves or I leave

the school is not big enough for the

both of us either he leaves or I leave

one of the two I can't take him a day

longer so then they called my dad and

said your son has to leave that's when I

ended up in BAL car and I met Leslie if

I had not been kicked out of there

never would have met Leslie so directly

from there they sent me they said don't

you worried that Inbal car they'll

accept you

the Adventist Academy of ball car that's

where I ended up the year was 1988 1988

when this happened that's when I met

Leslie that same day I was I mean that

same year I was halfway through the year

and that's when I met Leslie farewell

then but why did they kick me out which

was the last argument I had with this

professor what was the last one they are

the presence of Yeshua the last one was

when the guy dared to teach that you

sure

omnipresence since he but since it has

logic since he took a human body and he

glorified that human body but no matter

how glorified our human body is it will

never be omnipresent so then he left to

heaven with that human body and became

our high Kohan got old our high

intercessor and so then he with that

human body he lost forever his

omnipresence he lost it forever so then

he is omnipresent through the other

being whose name is the Holy Spirit

so then what he was teaching was that

Yeshua out of love for us made himself a

human forever that he was left and

closed in a human party from which he

cannot escape because he became

literally a human being so then my

question was which started the

discussion why should we worship Him if

he's no longer loved him he is like he

is he is God that's the way they speak

He is God he would tell me of course

he's God but a non abner presence God

what type of limited God is that it's

like but he did it for love

doesn't matter what we did for love or

whatever he is a limited being small the

other two are a lot more powerful than

him he's now their laughingstock he

could only be in one place while the

other two can be wherever they want to

and aside from that if he's limited in

that I would ask him what else is he

limited in because if he's a human being

like you say then he's also limited in

creation behaves cannot be as powerful

and his mind is also limited because

he's enclosed in a human body as well

everything of his is limited and he

would say yes it is all limited but it

is out of love for us he was like.he his

self pronouncement was so great that he

went from being an all-powerful Elohim

to an Elohim that's a little powerful

human the discussion elevated so much

that the professor stormed out of the

classroom and said I won't teach anymore

because it elevated to a different tone

that discussion did now I told you that

just to tell you I had already told you

and now

I'm reminding you of that for the sake

of those who are new the question is as

again I'll ask what you should do with

that human body because don't think for

one minute that when he says I go unto

the Father I go unto the father he's

saying I will go back to being the

father completely what'd he do with that

ugly body because it's tough enough it's

ugly

does that scripture say that it is ugly

eggie so that no one so that would no

one would fall in love with him or

desire ugly ugly what'd he do with that

body he put it away did one of you

inherit it here no no no wouldn't he be

keeping it safe for when he marries his

wife okay this here one of you from the

eternal truth wrote to me and told me

that in at first it surprised me but as

I stop to think and think and think and

once I understood all this I arrived at

the following conclusion when you sure

died you know that you sure fulfilled

all the prophecies there is fulfilling

the prophecy of of the Lamb of Pesa

fulfilling the prophecy of the he-goat

and of young keeper but also fulfilled a

very special prophecy that we studied

which is para Duma the red Hafer the red

heifer would be sacrificed any of you

don't know what the red heifer is look

up the red heifer in this very same

series right of you sure can't remember

what chapter it was 16 I believe 16 if

I'm not mistaken came no 10 of the

trumpets I believe it's 16 its para Duma

the red heifer and again review that

subject only give it the light that we

have now about the father and the son

United as only one being southern there

was a third altar there was the altar in

the temple there was also the incense

altar but there was a third altar

outside of the temple outside of the

city and it was placed precisely in

where was it placed exactly in the Olive

Garden

wait a minute it's not called the Olive

Garden it's called Mount the olive grove

the olive grove well anyways he was

there right in front of Jerusalem

where precisely are all the olive trees

planted outside of the temple there

there was an altar that no longer exists

but there was a bridge that would cross

precisely directly from the Mount of the

Olives up until a special entrance that

was in an area of of the wall of

Jerusalem and from that end he'd go to

the temple that is where they would burn

the red paper

the red hafer was for the purification

of the people of Israel if there's no

red heifer there's no purification it is

one of the most difficult prophecies to

understand what are the most difficult

rites to understand the Jews never

understood it again reviewed that sermon

because it's marvelous if there are new

things that we understand now if there

are new things that we understand now

then applied them the new things but

everything that I speak about para Duma

is absolutely marvelous now the red

heifer which served to purify the entire

people is assure himself because he show

himself died not where they say that it

was the gall kotha but rather died as

the prophecy said in the Mount of Olives

looking towards the Temple of Jerusalem

that's where he died netting a cross as

the Christians say but on a tree he was

placed on a tree he was crucified on a

tree we've already understood all that

we know it that tree possibly what tree

was it that I tell you it was Aaron's

rod in what type of a tree was it an

almond tree an almond tree that's I'm

telling you've missed out of that watch

it again just like that what type of

tree based on what tree is this men are

made an almond tree exactly an almond

tree there well then if the red heifer

was burned sacrificed and then had to be

entirely burnt and afterward the ashes

would be gathered and afterward with a

little bit of ashes in water they would

purify everything what sense is there in

a ritual if the body of Yeshua which he

took was not burned down to ashes do you

follow that that right is so nice the

way I explained it tell the truth it's

spectacular the way it's explained there

in the bride of Yeshua 16 but there is a

little problem that all that ritual of

cremation was never fulfilled cuz she

sure was not cremated I sure did not

explain that in that video

Yeshua died he was buried three days and

three nights and then resurrected that

does not fulfill the cremation of the

red heifer do follow veralyn if we're

understanding that point then possibly

and I don't want to be dogmatic here I'm

gonna leave this being as there's not

much information but it is really a part

of the parable of that right possibly

when you sure died that body died and

when he was raised from the dead he was

not raised along with that body but

rather that body was given to those in

charge who should be some angels who

cremated him and with that which they

cremated that real body which was used

by Yahweh which was a real body which

was entirely dominated and was utilized

only by Yahweh it could be that with the

ashes of that body a real parties will

talk of not symbolically a real body

it'd be the purification for all of us

because a little bit of ashes would

purify everything so then it could be

that even that body which lived and died

for us be that the ashes of that real

body because actually what proof is

there whether you sure came died

resurrected or any proof of him ever

coming and then the body disappeared

okay I want to make you think if Yahweh

came to this earth took a human body

they went back to heaven and again

became Yahweh what happened with that

the human body did it just disappear

what it's are you following because you

might say well he transformed it no no

yo it does not have to transform that

party

yeah well has to go back to being Yahweh

what he always was his original body yah

would do you follow which he took which

he never had before which he took in

which he used and he possessed

completely that body which died that

body

he cannot again use it because he would

no longer be how it he'd be assured do

you follow that body's name is Yeshua

with that name he made himself be known

he's Yahweh of course but that body if

that body was taken by the angels and

was cremated and those ashes were kept

safe and with those ashes he purifies

all of Israel and later those were saved

then marvelously what takes a new

perspective is para Duma because para

Duma that redheffer was sacrificed

precisely in that altar in the Mount of

Olives precisely there there was

cremated and later on it was kept in

those ashes there cannot be a temple

without those ashes that is why the Jews

are desperately looking for a red heifer

without it there's no temple no nothing

they need the red heifer to purify the

priests yeah it was also used to purify

the priests something well I don't know

why I say priests they're the Kahane da

Kahane I was way too into what I'm

saying because it is rather astonishing

so then now those in Israel now could be

in Spanish if you remove one syllable in

memes hogs so then those priests need

the red Hafer but the true Kahane need

to also be purified with the ashes of

the red heifer they need to be purified

and what red hafer what red heifer or

para de ma could be more important that

the actual body of yeshua cremated I

find that very interesting when I didn't

discover this I heard it as a comment in

that first I said I've never taught that

I don't know but it was spinning in my

head and now that I underst

this I noticed that that body is no

longer that body he can't we can never

again see that body the body of Yeshua

that's why when he appeared it says that

didn't even recognize him now the

question is now in order for him to be

recognized

then he need that old body or can he

present himself however he pleases

obviously he could present myself how it

replaces similar to him just like him or

different to him however he wants that's

why when he presented himself Mary

Magdalene didn't recognize him that's

why when these two disciples were on

their way to II miss they didn't

recognize him

later on he and her like Pancho it well

maybe we can't use that name Pancho for

him he entered not like a human being

does with a body but he went through the

walls he went through the walls and

presenting himself as he but he must

have presented himself in a similar form

but it was not that body because a human

body does not go through walls so then

he already had another nature D follow

[Music]

right

Yahweh eats with a brain no eats right

he ate with Abraham but I believe that

yahwah eats he is like us

yahwah eats yahwah eats how boring would

it be to not eat I mean who of you would

want to let's suppose that there is a

pill here a little smaller than this a

pill they said eat this and you will be

satisfied for your entire life and

you'll never again have to eat never

hunger have any problems who wants to

take it I would want to take it I like

to eat it is a pleasure to eat it is an

enormous pleasure Elohim designed it I

was just telling yet playing around

Elohim must eat or else he's not like us

hello he must eat or we don't look like

him let's see our Munda looks a little

worried no I just want to say that

eating is not just because of humans no

mean exactly everybody has to eat

exactly correct

he must have always prepared some food

and would eat that's what I understand

or else we would not be

the image and likeness of him perfect

well next Shabbat we shall then study

John 16 but I wanted to make this very

clear and as a and as homework for all

those who did not watch the topic I

spoke of last rabbit which is related

with this completely of which this is

the second part

watch shovelled 71 we shall continue

with this subject next shebat the bride

of yeshua 25 yahwah it had four and

there will be many in this series

there's lots to talk about

I want to make this very clear yeah

we're told the speak speak speak about

the subject and I will speak about the

subject since that is very clear but it

is also clear that we're in the time of

destruction at any moment now

it could begin or yeah we could make us

wait another year until the destruction

begins

that's not matter we have to have

present the entire time that for this

vision there's a date and a date written

and if it delays in our in our

perception it gets delayed because it

actually does not get too late it'll be

fulfilled in the date designed if it is

delayed wait for it because it does not

get delight as the text says if it gets

delayed in what we perceive that does

not mean that it is being delayed but it

means that we're a little more hurried

than what the actual date is but we

should enjoy this time because we won't

pass level 70 we should enjoy this

moment and take it really as if at any

moment now Yahweh will score a brutal

goal on this earth in the air seven

seven double goals right I said twenty

one last time but they are seven seven

because I like number seven and they're

double their goals huge goals that are

worth two yes what happens they're worth

two they are a trumpet plague and from

the fifth and on they are brutal goals

it's just whoa whoa and to the people

what does gold mean destruction it means

this truck

and destruction comes upon this earth

may the Lord bless each and every one of

you

Alleluia to every one of you we shall

meet again next chapter we shall

conclude with a word of Prayer

beloved yahweh that art in heaven thank

you lord we give thee for thou open the

scriptures that we may comprehend it

we thank you Lord because you actually

speak to us and show us that you are the

only eloheem that created the earth and

created us and you are the only being

this earth and you came to die for us

fulfilled
